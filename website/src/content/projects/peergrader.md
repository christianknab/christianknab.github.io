# Looking Ahead!
I created this project with three other students in CSE 115a. Given the one quarter time constraint, and it being my first web development project, we did not finish the project. I will be sponsoring our project for the CSE 115 B & C courses Winter and Spring 2025. As a sponsor I will hold code reviews and help the students plan features. The goal is to work with the students to create a completely finished product we can market to professors. Stay tuned!

# Original Problem

### The problem
Professors don’t have the bandwidth to grade hundreds of students. Students don’t like the current tool at UCSC: Crowdgrader.

### The goal
* Provide a cheap, modern design, with integration to Canvas gradebook for easy grade publishing
* A more intuitive interface to increase usability and confidence about submissions & grading

### Technologies
* Framework: Next.js
* Language: Typescript

### Infrastructure
* Auth: Supabase
* PostgreSQL database: Supabase
* Storage (files): Supabase
* Deployment: Vercel
